# Horiseon-Project
I developed this site to assist me in learning HTML5, CSS, and Git. 

As part of this challenge, I had to refactor existing code to make it more accessible.

In updating the site, I removed duplicate CSS rules and learned the importance of clean code. As a developer, I really enjoyed working on this project and it helped me hone my skills.
